# Re/Vision Counseling

## What is it?

Re/Vision Counseling is a free service which offers limited video-chat, instant-messenger, or email-based counseling. 

This type of counseling is a dialog between counselor and client which draws on a variety of theoretical and practical perspectives to  address "existential concerns",  such as a sense of emptiness about life, fears of meaninglessness, low self-confidence, social isolation or loneliness, and lack of long-term vision.

The purpose is to help clients establish a more grounded understanding of themselves and their values, to distinguish real growth from being trapped in old behavior and thinking patterns, to deal honestly and effectively with debilitating beliefs about themselves and life,  and to learn the basic skills that allow generating one's own authentic "being-in-the-world."

## Is this psychotherapy?

The counselors are volunteers, not professional therapists. While they undergo ongoing training and development in this type of counseling, they are not trained in psychotherapy or formal psychiatric methods, and Re/Vision Counseling is not a substitute for professional therapy, particularly in situations where a client is suffering from delusions, personality disorders, or recurring episodes of severe psychological disturbance.

Re/Vision Counselors do this work as an expression of their commitment to a better world -- their training in Re/Vision methods and their personal insights are the basis of the approach. 

We recognize a distinction between the kinds of existential concerns that all people have at times, versus general psychiatric problems and personality disorders.  A Re/Vision Counselor is not permitted to counsel those who need professional help, and we strive to identify such individuals and redirect them toward professional therapy and psychiatry.

## Is this for teens too?

We realize that many teens suffer from these same kinds of existential issues, however we do not counsel anyone under the age of 16.  Child development is a specialized and critical area, and Re/Vision Counselors are not trained to work with children on these topics.

## How are sessions provided?

When you sign up for Re/Vision Counseling, you'll be contacted by a counselor who will work with you to schedule a first session by Internet video-chat, instant messaging, or e-mail.  

In general, video-chat is the best option if you have the technical resources *(we use Skype, Facetime, or Google Hangouts, all of which are available for multiple types of devices without charge.)*

## How long are sessions, and how many can one have?

Most counseling sessions last one hour, and we limit the service to 10 sessions per client. This allows us to serve more clients and keep the focus on conditions which can be reasonably addressed by this kind of dialog; this is not intended as long-term support or "life coaching."
