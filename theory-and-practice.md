# Re/Vision Counseling

## Live Theory

[This post](https://www.quora.com/When-did-you-learn-to-start-loving-yourself/answer/Les-Matheson-1?share=f19da144&srid=C3lY) offers a quick pass over the territory that we're trying to cover in counseling -- it's not theoretically "pure", it's intended to connect metaphorically with the reader's personal experiences... so you could say this is "live theory": theory that sacrifices accuracy and completeness in exchange for being somewhat accessible and meaningful to someone who's likely to be in the target demographic of our clients.

The 'live theory' underlying Re/Vision counseling is that we're guiding clients toward an existential maturity in which the self is the "parent" of their life, instead of being an alienated child trying to fix its pain and alienation.  This is a sloppy way to talk about transformation, but it draws on existing concepts that they already have, and evokes a metaphor of the perspective shift which allows someone to get a quick (albeit incomplete and distorted) glimpse of the intended meaning.

Live theory is much more understandable than "dry theory", because it's more connected to familiar concepts that the listener already has.   So if live theory is so nice, why don't we just dispense with dry theory?  Why bother struggling to grasp the abstract and theoretically pure concepts that guide the journey?

The main problem with live theory is that it doesn't generalize well: just because you get it, doesn't mean someone else will get it.  Just because you get it in one context doesn't mean you'll recognize it when it shows up an a different context.   The ability to generalize a pattern of meaning, so that it's recognizable when it's not showing up in a familiar form, is the power of dry theory.

I often get accused *(even by myself!)* of being too fond of dry theory.  "You've got to say it in a way that people understand!" is the sound of that complaint, and it's a familiar refrain that I often agree with.   But at the end of the day, we need the skills to replicate reliably -- like DNA, which is able to copy itself faithfully often enough to ensure the viability of a species, dry theory is the DNA of Re/Vision as a philosophical perspective and practice of growth.  

Getting it right means getting it in the most general forms: the forms that are nearly mathematical in their correctness, but as in pure math, the advanced students don't do "word problems" anymore, so they're less likely to be speaking in terms of how many apples Jane has that Michael takes away, and more likely to speak in a language that neither Jane nor Michael understand.

So yes -- it's hard to recognize dry theory as having anything to do with how we feel about ourselves or our lives.  But if you master dry theory, and master the challenge of connecting it up with the client's personal experience, then you're in a good position to be helpful to a broad range of clients, as well as being better able to sort out your own confusion when it shows up wearing an unfamiliar mask.

## Dry Theory

A summary of the dry theory underlying Re/Vision follows:

The human mind has innate tools which it uses to make sense of reality -- to "make meaning."  We rose to the top of the food chain owing largely to the power afforded by these tools.

As an example of what I mean by a "tool", consider the word *discrimination*:  the ability to specify a difference between "this" and "that".  

The early human observes the behavior of elk in the forest, and notices something that less astute creatures fail to notice:  when the male elk is done mating, he takes a longish nap and the herd's defenses are diminished.

Exploiting the power of their sophisticated communication and the cooperative hunting it enables, the human hunters are able to signal each other over long distances: when one of them spots a mating couple, word passes quickly and they gather for the nap.

The mind has *distinguished* that there is a difference in the defenses of the herd, and the line which differentiates that special state is "mating has occurred".  A chain of causality is *attributed*:  "the male has mated, next he will sleep, and then it will be dinnertime for us!"

Discrimination and cause-attribution are two of the tools of the mind.  There are more, but that's enough to make the point: our intelligence can be understood by overlaying the topic with a set of categories that highlight distinct abilities -- discrimination, attribution, conceptualization, classification, ordering, transcending -- to call these abilities "tools" highlights the way that the mind works with them to produce meaning -- to make sense of reality and assemble models of how reality works.

That mode of operation, enabled by the high level of refinement of our "semantic toolkit", gave us a survival advantage and allowed us to take over the planet, so much so that we're now the planet's greatest threat.

In general, we wield these tools without thinking about them.  Our hands wrap around the handles seamlessly, we cut wood without recognizing that we're holding a saw, we nail boards without knowing the word "hammer": nobody taught us these skills formally, they spring spontaneously into action as we grow from infancy and learn to organize the moment-to-moment flow of our experience into mental models which represent the knowledge that we rely on to survive, pursue comfort and pleasure, play and work, etc.

To say that our tools are powerful is correct, but that doesn't mean that everything that we do with those tools is correct.  We make a ton of nonsense, along with the valid models of reality that we build.  The history of human thought is absolutely littered with the debris of our meaning-making mistakes: we get it wrong at least as often as we get it right, perhaps.

A thorough discussion of why we make so many mistakes is beyond the scope of this, but psychology and philosophy textbooks abound with long lists of the fallacies and distortions that the human mind is prone to fall into.  I'm just treating it as a given here that while we're the smartest kids on the evolutionary block, we still screw up a lot cognitively.  What we think is real is often not real, and the models that we build with our powerful tools are often missing major elements, incorrectly assembled, or pure fabrications of imagination -- places where we filled in the gaps in our understanding by making stuff up from whole cloth.

And we're not very good at distinguishing what's real from what we made up.  And we're not even very good at appreciating how not-good-at-this we are: we're sort of arrogant about the quality of our knowledge.  Like... the arrogance that one might have if they've risen to the top of the food chain on the strength of their knowledge-building, such that there's no lion threatening to eat them because they got it wrong on a given day.

Eventually we look in the mirror: we start to notice the thing which is trying to survive and live.



## Theory and Practice Overview

These two aspects (theory and practice) need to collaborate in Re/Vision counseling.

Practice is the art of turning the theory into something personal for the client.   If we just present the dry theory so that the client understands the approach and the big ideas that our method is based on, it shows up as "ivory tower thinking", or worse -- "something I won't be able to grasp."

When people hear the theory but can't connect it to their own experience, it's quite likely that they'll either reject the theory as incorrect/meaningless, or assess themselves as inadequate in some way.

Theory has to be correlated with the client's experience so that it makes sense to them, and that's what a lot of the conversations are about: the client is talking about their life, their feelings, their thoughts, their history, and the counselor is connecting that content up to the theoretical framework, so that the client is able to "see" the theory in terms that are personal and relevant.

But we can't dispense with theory: not only does the counselor need to understand, but the client's understanding needs to grow during the course of counseling.  Ideally, the client's understanding of the theory would match the counselor's before they're discharged, but that's not something we should expect or hold as a threshold of success.

### Is there an ideal pacing?

I thinks that the ideal pacing is when the client hears just enough theory to allow them to see down the road for the near future: like a auto satellite navigation system, the driver gets a good view of upcoming turns or the next few miles of highway, without being overwhelmed by the myriad connecting roads between their current location and a distant destination.

This kind of growth is challenging, and having a theoretical grasp of the map immediately ahead is important to help someone summon the courage to take that next step.  If they have to study the whole map and grasp it all before they start, the chances of starting diminish: how many casual hikers would decide to climb Mount Everest?  But if one moderate hike leads to the next, and eventually someone hands them an oxygen mask and they haven't already turned back, they make just peace with the idea that they're going to the summit.

So I don't normally talk to people about coherence if it's clear that they're struggling with conformity issues: even if they're able to grasp the theory of conformity, they won't do anything useful with that theory -- at best, it will turn into some weird ego defense: a pride that they understand coherence, as if that conceptual understanding was "it".
