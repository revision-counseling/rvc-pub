# Re/Vision Counseling

## Live Theory

[This post](https://www.quora.com/When-did-you-learn-to-start-loving-yourself/answer/Les-Matheson-1?share=f19da144&srid=C3lY) offers a quick pass over the territory that we're trying to cover in counseling -- it's not theoretically "pure", it's intended to connect metaphorically with the reader's personal experiences... so you could say this is "live theory": theory that sacrifices accuracy and completeness in exchange for being somewhat accessible and meaningful to someone who's likely to be in the target demographic of our clients.

The 'live theory' underlying Re/Vision counseling is that we're guiding clients toward an existential maturity in which the self is the "parent" of their life, instead of being an alienated child trying to fix its pain and alienation.  This is a sloppy way to talk about transformation, but it draws on existing concepts that they already have, and evokes a metaphor of the perspective shift which allows someone to get a quick (albeit incomplete and distorted) glimpse of the intended meaning.

Live theory is much more understandable than "dry theory", because it's more connected to familiar concepts that the listener already has.   So if live theory is so nice, why don't we just dispense with dry theory?  Why bother struggling to grasp the abstract and theoretically pure concepts that guide the journey?

The main problem with live theory is that it doesn't generalize well: just because you get it, doesn't mean someone else will get it.  Just because you get it in one context doesn't mean you'll recognize it when it shows up an a different context.   The ability to generalize a pattern of meaning, so that it's recognizable when it's not showing up in a familiar form, is the power of dry theory.

I often get accused *(even by myself!)* of being too fond of dry theory.  "You've got to say it in a way that people understand!" is the sound of that complaint, and it's a familiar refrain that I often agree with.   But at the end of the day, we need the skills to replicate reliably -- like DNA, which is able to copy itself faithfully often enough to ensure the viability of a species, dry theory is the DNA of Re/Vision as a philosophical perspective and practice of growth.  

Getting it right means getting it in the most general forms: the forms that are nearly mathematical in their correctness, but as in pure math, the advanced students don't do "word problems" anymore, so they're less likely to be speaking in terms of how many apples Jane has that Michael takes away, and more likely to speak in a language that neither Jane nor Michael understand.

So yes -- it's hard to recognize dry theory as having anything to do with how we feel about ourselves or our lives.  But if you master dry theory, and master the challenge of connecting it up with the client's personal experience, then you're in a good position to be helpful to a broad range of clients, as well as being better able to sort out your own confusion when it shows up wearing an unfamiliar mask.

## Dry Theory

The theory underlying Re/Vision counseling can be presented either "top-down" or "bottom-up": that is, we can start by talking about coherent self, and then walk backwards from that to show how its absence results in an ego that is trapped in conformity (top-down), or we can talk about how the meaning of 'self', starting as an ego trapped in conformity,  can be untangled and finally self-grounded to become coherent (bottom-up)

In general, it just works better to approach this bottom-up, because that's where the trail head is -- that's where people can hear the relevance of the path to their own life.


## Theory and Practice Overview

These two aspects (theory and practice) need to collaborate in Re/Vision counseling.

Practice is the art of turning the theory into something personal for the client.   If we just present the dry theory so that the client understands the approach and the big ideas that our method is based on, it shows up as "ivory tower thinking", or worse -- "something I won't be able to grasp."

When people hear the theory but can't connect it to their own experience, it's quite likely that they'll either reject the theory as incorrect/meaningless, or assess themselves as inadequate in some way.

Theory has to be correlated with the client's experience so that it makes sense to them, and that's what a lot of the conversations are about: the client is talking about their life, their feelings, their thoughts, their history, and the counselor is connecting that content up to the theoretical framework, so that the client is able to "see" the theory in terms that are personal and relevant.

But we can't dispense with theory: not only does the counselor need to understand, but the client's understanding needs to grow during the course of counseling.  Ideally, the client's understanding of the theory would match the counselor's before they're discharged, but that's not something we should expect or hold as a threshold of success.

### Is there an ideal pacing?

I thinks that the ideal pacing is when the client hears just enough theory to allow them to see down the road for the near future: like a auto satellite navigation system, the driver gets a good view of upcoming turns or the next few miles of highway, without being overwhelmed by the myriad connecting roads between their current location and a distant destination.

This kind of growth is challenging, and having a theoretical grasp of the map immediately ahead is important to help someone summon the courage to take that next step.  If they have to study the whole map and grasp it all before they start, the chances of starting diminish: how many casual hikers would decide to climb Mount Everest?  But if one moderate hike leads to the next, and eventually someone hands them an oxygen mask and they haven't already turned back, they make just peace with the idea that they're going to the summit.

So I don't normally talk to people about coherence if it's clear that they're struggling with conformity issues: even if they're able to grasp the theory of conformity, they won't do anything useful with that theory -- at best, it will turn into some weird ego defense: a pride that they understand coherence, as if that conceptual understanding was "it".
