## The Need and the Opportunity

In my years of informally counseling people with "existential issues", it's been abundantly clear that the demand for this kind of dialog outstrips the supply by orders of magnitude: millions of people lack access to viable and competent support --- there's no one to talk to who understands how they feel or has any idea what to do about it.

In some countries, professional therapists and counselors are nearly non-existent or priced out of range of most residents, and the only quality counselors available are spiritual leaders and teachers who bring a religious perspective that either poses a barrier to communication with the client, or which shifts the focus of the counselor towards proselytizing and flock-building and away from producing near-term results for the client.

So many people are suffering from concerns that are fairly straightforward to address, but they lack access to competent guidance.  Their inability to sort out their values, vision, and growth has ripple effects on their relationships, families, and community: that individual is potentially a leverage-point for making a difference, such that if they can find ground under their feet, others around them benefit as well.

The opportunity to make a difference here is distinct: for those whose lives are already healthy, and who sense a calling to help those who are struggling, Re/Vision offers a practical pathway to expressing that concern.  The role of being a Re/Vision Counselor is designed to be suitable for laypeople who want to help and are looking for a way to express that desire in a reasonable form which fits with their typically busy lives.

The role involves a certain commitment on your part, details are provided below.

Re/Vision draws on a particular approach to counseling which I developed over a period of many years of experimentation, conversation, and study of multiple disciplines and approaches: it is "my own distillation of what works for me" rather than some clinically-tested or academically-oriented body of knowledge and practice.

Yes: if you understand the values and goals of the program, and see it as an opportunity to express your vision of a better world, please contact us to arrange an exploratory conversation about becoming a Counselor.

Counselors must be of legal age to enter contracts in their host country *(18 years of age in the U.S.)*  The basic requirement is that your own basic needs are already being met, such that you can be available to help others without being preoccupied by concerns for your own well-being, health, or living conditions.

Counselors are trained before being permitted to work with clients; the duration and details of training vary by individual.  Counselors commit to a minimum level of service, and agree to certain intellectual-property constraints and quality-control guidelines which are designed to ensure that the program is delivered with integrity consistently. 

Counselors may not charge for services: i.e. you may not advertise yourself as "someone who does Re/Vision Counseling" and accept money.  The use of certain terms to refer to your activities is restricted to maintain the spirit and intent of the program.  

Our goal is to maintain a free service accessible to those who lack other options; if you want to start a professional counseling business or practice, this is not the right place for you.

Please contact us for more details.
