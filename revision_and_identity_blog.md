## Re/vision How-to

People who read my rantings about human identity sometimes comment about the weight of the theory being expressed. That usually comes in the form of a veiled complant: "yeah, but what should I **do**?"

To repent and redeem my years of negligence for not offering practical advice, here's some favorite "how-to" tools.

But first: [some theory](https://www.quora.com/Is-the-ego-maintained-after-enlightening-ones-being-to-the-point-of-completion-of-the-reunification-of-the-mind/answer/Les-Matheson-1?srid=C3lY)!

There's a lot of practical things people can do, and I would endorse a lot of what others say on this topic, even though in many cases we might not agree on the underlying theory.  Bottom line: if something works for you, don't be shy about using it, but avoid getting too loyal to the explanation of *why* it works,  because that explanation is probably wrong or incomplete.

Ok.  Enough of that.  What should one *do* to grow and realize a more complete kind of self and so on? Here's some suggestions you might not find so readily just scanning the vast amount of literature on the subject:

### Stop Pretending: or at least acknowledge it.

There's a peeling-the-onion quality to growing authenticity: pretense and self-deception are the opaque outer layers that make it hard to see what's going on inside.

To say "stop pretending" is probably not very helpful: most people who care about authenticity would stop pretending if they could, but often find that the compulsion toward public posturing is too strong, or the temptation to self-deception is irresistible.

If you can't actually *stop* pretending, there's a next-best-thing:  acknowledge it.  The more you can acknowledge your pretenses and self-deceptions, the easier it is to move to the next step of actually interrupting that tendency.

This is particularly true if you can acknowledge your pretenses *publicly*: being able to "own up" to being a fraud can be quite liberating.  If you can admit to a friend that you're habitually "faking it" in some specific way, that's a powerful step toward freedom.

If you can admit to faking it in front of a whole community of friends and family, you're really driving in the fast lane then.

The ultimate goal of this idea is to "own the pretender": to stop fighting with the truth of the fact that you tend to pretend and have powerful incentives baked-in to your psychology which drive this behavior.

I use a "dictionary of self" metaphor to talk about how to relate to the various meanings of "I": what you want is to allow many different meanings, rather than clinging to some and rejecting others.  The idea is to relate to all meanings as "possible forms of self", rather than "some are me and some are not."

So "I'm a pretender" is one entry in the dictionary.  "I'm someone who wishes to stop pretending" is another entry. The game here is to recognize the "space" of the dictionary as a set of possibilities, rather than getting transfixed by a particular self-concept or a specfic favorite definition of self.   You want to loosen up the rigid and anxiety-driven clinging which grips tightly to some ideas while rejecting others. You want to let go of the self-judgments and recriminations about being a pretender, without going to the other extreme and justifying endless indulgence in pretense.

"I'm a pretender" is one that you've been trying to reject.  Stop doing that -- make room for *what is*, give it a place in the dictionary of self -- it's not the whole story, but it's a valid possibility for what you can be.

That's "owning the pretender": stop freaking out about it.  Yes, you have this tendency to inauthenticity, just like all humans.  Welcome to the club: tell the truth about it, give it some room to breathe, it's OK -- this is not the end of the world, this is a part of the human condition that you're working to take ownership of, so you can recover your freedom.



### Practicing mindfulness

I often advocate mindfulness practice, which is a general nod in the direction of anything which helps one to be more self-aware. That doesn't necessarily mean formal awareness meditation where you sit on a cushion, dim the lights, and turn off the TV -- but that's still a good idea.

You can practice awareness anywhere: learning to "follow the breath" is a basic and ancient technique that never goes out of style.  One benefit of this is that because it's so simple and repetitive, your thoughts and feelings tend to show up in starker contrast, which makes them easier to see.

If you've given yourself the job of just "following the breath in and out", then that's the only legitimate and intentional activity going on, and everything else is the mind churning up the water.  So you can look around and see that stuff going on and it registers that "this is not consciously-chosen cognitive activity", and you can get clear about how much of what your mind is doing is automatic, and how pervasive that is, and start to enquire about what it's doing and why.

This is indeed easier to do if you learn to sit properly in a suitable environment with a disciplined schedule, but it is possible to practice awareness under almost any conditions, and it's a basic skill that's very useful for growth.

## Learn to recognize the tape loops

We spend a lot of our lives sleepwalking: our choices and actions are "running on autopilot."  Anyone who has driven a car for years recognizes the phenomenon in which you arrive at your destination, but upon reflection cannot recall any of the features of the journey that got you there.

That "autopilot amnesia" is similar to how we live much of our lives: the path of least resistance is easy because it's habitual and familiar.

I'm not criticizing automated behavior: if you're going to brush your teeth several times a day, it makes sense to have a procedure for that and just execute the same actions every time.

But when we're talking about true self and having life be meaningful, automated behavior isn't so innocuous: "living unconsciously" is largely about having patterns of thinking and action which are so habitual that little or no actual reflection or awareness is involved even for the big things -- like how you relate to your spouse or children, how you choose your career, how you spend your free time, and what you see when you look in the mirror.

To "awaken" in any given context, one must recognize and interrupt the mind's tendency to automate everything.  The mind is quite good at building "good enough" patterns: reactive step-by-step responses for how we interpret situations, instant judgments of others or ourselves, fast-acting "fix-it" plans which are like the guy who only has a hammer so he always sees a nail, and so on.

That automaticity is efficient, it saves the precious resource of conscious attention.  But if you're automating the important things in life, that tends to limit your growth and development: you'll automate it to be as comfortable and stress-free as possible, you probably won't choose the path of greatest growth in any given situation.

Where this matters most is in your understanding of who and what you are: the tape loops that respond to the question "who am I?" are the most critical places where inappropriate automation dominates.   It's almost never a good idea to just replay an old self-concept in order to comfort yourself that your identity is on solid ground.

Certain self-concepts get placed on tape loops by the mind and replayed endlessly.  You can practice listening to your own thoughts with the intention of catching those tape loops in real time: you want to identify the answer to "what self-concept is playing now?" and see if you can recognize it as just one possible answer to "who am I?", rather than the whole story about your identity.

When you challenge those concepts, it's typical to get a sense of both uncertainty and freedom: uncertainty occurs because you're allowing yourself to doubt the validity or completeness of your self-concept, and freedom occurs because the self-concept is operating like a trap until you notice it and distinguish it as just one possible meaning of "I".

So if you feel uncertain and free when doing this, that's normal and a sign that you're doing it well.

Notice the common theme here again: it's not that your self-concept is entirely wrong, but it's just one kind of answer to "who am I?", and there are many possibilities.  It is one of many *meanings* for "I", but when you're stuck in that one pigeonhole, you can't see that the spectrum of possibilities is much broader than that little box.

Recovering that perspective is important: the dictionary-of-self has many entries, and true self isn't any of them... it's more like the dictionary as a whole.  *(But that's another topic.)*

## Serve value and possibility

Your mind cannot expand far enough to grasp true self.  This is the fundamental problem that makes this topic of true self so confusing.

It's like trying to visualize infinity: if you've ever tried it, you know that this just doesn't work -- your mind cannot expand it's image-making powers so that you can "wrap your head around" infinity.

But, infinity is actually very simple to understand if you reduce it to a formula:  "take a number, add 1.  Take the result, and repeat the previous step."

Notice how that formula or procedure is very simple, but it has no exit -- it does not tell you when to quit!  So, it's a formula for infinity, and it's easy to understand, and it does not break your mind's concept-making equipment.

So while you can't *conceive* of infinity as a mental image, you can have a *strategy* for producing it which is pretty straightforward.

A similar thing applies to true self: your mind cannot grasp it as an image, because it's naturally "unbounded".  But, it is possible to represent the "formula for realizing true self", and it's not even that complicated.

Using my "dictionary of self" metaphor, you can understand true self as the whole dictionary, rather than any single entry or self-concept: true self is a "context" or "space of meaning".  That's part of the formula.

Another part is that this dictionary can grow without limits: you can keep adding entries to it for as long as you live, and new self-concepts are based on new distinctions of what you are, and those new distinctions are not "true self" but they're particular possibilities for representing or expressing yourself.
